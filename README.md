## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hojung Yu

### ðŸ‘€ I am interested in urban data visualization and analytics.
 
My research interests focus on urban visualization and analytics. I believe data visualization can help citizens develop creative insights or solidify existing ideas, fostering diverse dialogues. Data visualization, in my view, has immense power to bridge citizensâ€™ ideas and beliefs.
